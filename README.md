**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the replication time challenges in Viewstamped Replication (VR), a consensus protocol widely used in distributed systems for ensuring consistency and fault tolerance. As the number of nodes increases, VR suffers from high replication delays due to its quorum-based communication model. These delays negatively impact system throughput and responsiveness, especially in performance-critical or real-time environments. To address this, the paper proposes an alternative approach using the ZAB (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast) protocol to reduce replication time. The solution aims to maintain VRâ€™s reliability while improving scalability and operational efficiency in large distributed systems.
