**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the replication time challenges in Viewstamped Replication (VR), a consensus protocol widely used in distributed systems for ensuring consistency and fault tolerance. As the number of nodes increases, VR suffers from high replication delays due to its quorum-based communication model. These delays negatively impact system throughput and responsiveness, especially in performance-critical or real-time environments. To address this, the paper proposes an alternative approach using the ZAB (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast) protocol to reduce replication time. The solution aims to maintain VRâ€™s reliability while improving scalability and operational efficiency in large distributed systems.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Algorithm Enhancement:** \
Developed and refined replication mechanisms by integrating the ZAB protocol to reduce replication delays in Viewstamped Replication.

* **Performance Improvement:** \
Evaluated and demonstrated reduced replication time and improved scalability compared to traditional quorum-based VR communication.

* **Research Leadership:** \
  Directed the research and technical execution, concentrating on enhancing distributed databases via innovative algorithm development.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**

* **Replication Time Optimization:** \
Addressed replication delays in Viewstamped Replication (VR) by introducing the ZAB protocol, reducing communication overhead in large node clusters.

* **Scalability and Efficiency Enhancement:** \
Improved system throughput and responsiveness in distributed environments by minimizing replication time while preserving fault tolerance and consistency.

* **Academic Recognition :** \
    Discussed in scholarly articles and technical documents focusing on DNS query handling and performance improvements in ETCD.
* **Educational Impact:** \
    Incorporated into research projects, supporting continuous academic dialogue on container orchestration and cloud system efficiency.
